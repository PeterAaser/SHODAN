* TODO Investigate signal processing methods
** Implementation
*** Native libraries
*** Matlab -> JVM
*** Offload to FPGA
**** Chisel!
*** Offload to DSP

** Theoretical
*** HÃ¸r med Geir og Martinius

* TODO Better DI
** TODO Figure out best practice for DI
*** TODO Try out Free monad, ReaderWriter, or tagless final encoding (ps I have no fucking idea..)
** DONE SHODAN should be able to select experiment params from either file of conf.
   CLOSED: [2017-05-18 to. 16:54]
   Shitty version is in fact done

* TODO Implement throttling streams
* TODO Visualize spike detection
* TODO Improve visualizers
* TODO Rething user interaction
* TODO Reimplement stimuli
* TODO Refactor pipe assemblies again

* TODO Better UX
** Must be able to start/restart without refreshing webpage
** MEAME2 must be able to handle all sorts of bullshit from the frontend
** Robustness must be enforced, clicking two buttons to visualize is unacceptable


* Sist gang
* Database specification
** ER
   For each experiment
*** Metadata
   Experiment parameters
   Date (start, finish)
   Culture name
   Textual description

*** Experiment data
   Raw data chunks?

   On experiment start: if data recording: create an experimentInfo field and a set of channelRecordings.
   Each channelRecording should get its own sink for storing data.
** Use cases
*** Query for all recordings in some timespan
*** Query for all recordings with length over 4 minutes
*** Reading the experiment the runner decides to retry from some timestamp with a different filter
*** A program reads both raw data and a processed stream (spike data)
*** A program processes spike detection for all recordings in some range of time

* Database notes
** To open db in terminal:
   peter$~/:    sudo su postgres 
   postgres$~/: psql -d world -U postgres
  
   select name from country;
   \q
** To redo a database
   peter$~/:    sudo su postgres 
   postgres$~/: psql -c 'drop database $db;' -U postgres
   postgres$~/: psql -c 'create database $db;' -U postgres
   postgres$~/: psql -c '\i $db.sql' -d $db -U postgres
   
   
* About neurons
** Filtering
   None of these assumptions have any sort of neurological basis, they're just assumed
   in order to get a working prototype.

   I assume maximum amount of spikes we're interested in recording is 50 per second
