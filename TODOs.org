* TODO Create main control module
** Inner loop
*** TODO Inner loop should be responsible for trying out N different ANNs for s seconds resetting the server
*** DONE Refactor inner loop
    CLOSED: [2017-03-11 lø. 17:01]
    Inner loop must be refactored to offer a pipeline where stages are more suited for working
    in parallel without duplicating work
*** TODO Add pipe rebuilding to some criteria
**** TODO Create proof of concept
**** TODO Add self modifying ANN pipe
** Outer loop
*** TODO Should dispatch the inner loop
**** TODO MEAME needs an API for selecting datastream
**** TODO should create the bulk logging task and inner loop task with MEAME sockets
*** DONE Should be responsible for opening the server connections to MEAME
    CLOSED: [2017-03-11 lø. 17:01]
*** TODO Outer loop should log all incoming data from MEAME
**** DONE Create flat fileWriter
     CLOSED: [2017-03-11 lø. 17:01]
**** TODO Write to database
*** TODO Search for suitable channels
    Figure out which channels respond to stimuli and select them as
    primary acquisition/stimulation electrodes.
** Spec
   Control module should:
*** Should open connection to server
*** Should modify the pipe by replacing it with a new version
*** Modification should be done by listening to various feedback from the current pipe


* TODO Create RPC pipes
** Notes
   When a new MEAMEControl is instantiated the constructor should return a stream.
   This stream will be connected to all available input actions, pat match it from there.


* TODO Better DI
** TODO Figure out best practice for DI
*** TODO Try out Free monad
** TODO SHODAN should be able to select experiment params from either file of conf.
*** Create parses for params


* TODO Make website prettier
** Notes
   Needs to be webscale


* General
** TODO Fix alternator
   Doesn't look right, and even if it is it's much too arcane so a rewrite can't hurt


* Notes
** Logging
   In order to log what SHODAN does and thinks it could be useful to implement a logging scheme.
   This is possibly something best done with Task (or F[_].. ), check it out.
