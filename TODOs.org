* how 2 fs2 fra gitter (ikke slett plz)
Yeah, I do that in too many places
but soon I've got a working version out, then I'm gonna refactor and write good tests and all that jazz while the stable version automagically outputs research data
and everyone will be happy

Fabio Labella @SystemFw 15:51
then you'd need to write the usual recursive function as you do with Pulls in general
and then recursive(input).stream to get a Pipe

PeterAaser @PeterAaser 15:52
btw, is there a good place to get an idea of how fs2 works on the inside?

Fabio Labella @SystemFw 15:52
yes
the code :stuck_out_tongue:

PeterAaser @PeterAaser 15:52
Say I want to learn enough about to fs2 to actually contribute

Fabio Labella @SystemFw 15:52
sorry

PeterAaser @PeterAaser 15:52
How would you start

Fabio Labella @SystemFw 15:52
so there's a few layers, so to speak

PeterAaser @PeterAaser 15:52
I've actually read much of the code, but I tend to not stray into the core parts where scary things lie

Fabio Labella @SystemFw 15:53
so what I do

PeterAaser @PeterAaser 15:53
like don't ask me what a FreeC is (Free and coyoneda?)

Fabio Labella @SystemFw 15:53
no, that's just a Free monad with an extra constructor to take care of exception handling
cats Free already has coyoneda embedded in it
so I have a few random suggestions
first of all, master the Stream api (apart from where concurrency is involved)
assuming that it works by magic
but like, try and figure out what each method does, how to combine them, useful patterns and the like

PeterAaser @PeterAaser 15:55
I'm pretty good at the stream API. My activity in this channel might give a false impression, but that's because I usually only ask when I need to do something stupid :stuck_out_tongue:

Fabio Labella @SystemFw 15:55
lol I was speaking in general, not your specific knowledge :stuck_out_tongue:

PeterAaser @PeterAaser 15:56
but it's definitely a good place to keep improving

Fabio Labella @SystemFw 15:56
then do the same, but learning about the implementations
which are kinda divided in different categories
i.e. things that are written in terms of other streams combinators <- these are the best
concurrency/cats-effect <- I'll tell you about this in a second
things that are implemented using Pull <- this are the second best

PeterAaser @PeterAaser 15:57
How about stuff like scopes which aren't really visible to the end user?

Fabio Labella @SystemFw 15:57
things that are primitives <- last

PeterAaser @PeterAaser 15:57
unless something that shouldn't explode explodes

Fabio Labella @SystemFw 15:57
well, you just need to figure out the core interpreter for that
so Algebra
it's tricky, not gonna lie

PeterAaser @PeterAaser 15:58
haha I remember some of the signatures from 0.9

Fabio Labella @SystemFw 15:58
a good exercise is to dive into the async package, however
it's kinda standalone

PeterAaser @PeterAaser 15:58
The algebraF thing
that's a good tip

Fabio Labella @SystemFw 15:58
what I did
is spending a weekend going from the Java memory model (which you need to understand the lock-free queue used in actor)
then from actor to the implementation of Ref
than from the semantics of Ref to the concurrent data structures
and then from there to the concurrent combinators join, start concurrently and so on

PeterAaser @PeterAaser 16:00
That's for the async part, right?

Fabio Labella @SystemFw 16:00
yes
there's kinda two styles of concurrency is fs2 (this is my own informal split, so don't take it for granted)

PeterAaser @PeterAaser 16:00
Right, that sounds like a good way to go about it

Fabio Labella @SystemFw 16:00
stuff in async, which I've just mentioned
and stuff like merge, which ultimately relies on AsyncPull
but the async package itself is challenging enough as a start, imho
one extra tip
you don't have to go all the way down
for example, there's no need to understand how Actor works

PeterAaser @PeterAaser 16:01
Yeah, that's a good point

Fabio Labella @SystemFw 16:01
its semantics are very clear, so you can assume them as primitives
because understanding actor can be very tricky
I'm keen on low level concurrency so I did that
but it's not necessary
unless you fancy reading about lock-free algorithms in C

PeterAaser @PeterAaser 16:02
Haha, I'm running the parallel computations coursework at my university
I try very hard to avoid semaphores and similar unless I absolutely have to

Fabio Labella @SystemFw 16:03
You should also bear in mind that I'm a maintainer, and I don't know everything about the library yet

PeterAaser @PeterAaser 16:03
It's just impossible to get them right consistantly

Fabio Labella @SystemFw 16:03
so you could definitely contribute something while you learn
well, the fs2 semaphores are quite nice :P
but yeah, have you ever used haskell STM?

PeterAaser @PeterAaser 16:04
Thanks a lot, I hope I get some free time soon so I can finally go back to dagobah and finish my jedi training
No, learning haskell is on my to-do list
can't be that hard to learn haskell when I write functional scala

Fabio Labella @SystemFw 16:04
:+1:
sweetest concurrency model I've used
actually, you're mostly going to find that a lot of things are easier/less convoluted
although I really like scala as well

PeterAaser @PeterAaser 16:05
I really prefer scalas syntax, it's much easier for me to parse
although I dislike curly braces
and the type inferenc
Like how can Nil not be inferred
aornshdi

Fabio Labella @SystemFw 16:06
ime, syntax really does depend on habit
I used to hate scala syntax and its noise
now I don't mind it at all

PeterAaser @PeterAaser 16:06
(0 /: List[A[Lot[Of[Stuff]]]]())(_+_)

Fabio Labella @SystemFw 16:06
lol

PeterAaser @PeterAaser 16:06
instead of (0 /: Nil)(_+_)
but apart from that I find scalas type declarations to be very informative and I don't mind them at all

Fabio Labella @SystemFw 16:07
foldl' 0 (+)
the kind syntax is atrocious

PeterAaser @PeterAaser 16:08
I quite like /:
oh yes
but bearable with macros luckily
that's why I bet on scala, because shit like that ends up being fixed
and not just with boilerplate tools
lol, friend sent me this

** GA terminates after one evaluation
   Turns out the filter terminated after TicksPerEval,
   however we need 5*ticksPerEval for 5 challenges!
   This is a hint that the current method isn't very
   ergonomical, it should not be the responsibility of
   the filter to know when it's done.

** Figuring out how to represent state in SHODAN
   Having a commandPipe seems like a decent approach, but 
   I don't like how it currently does not really alter its 
   state inbetween updates.
   
*** Problem 1: The frontend does not get updated. 
    The commandpipe and the frontend does not share a model.
    I want a react-ish model where state changes in the
    commandpipe and the actions it is running will automatically 
    be visible to the frontend.
    
*** Problem 2: Commandpipe is essentially stateless.
    The commandpipe is not in a good state at the moment.
    Warts such as uns*feRun in StartMEAME and generally finding 
    it difficult to alter the go function inbetween invocations.
    
*** Possible solutions:
**** Signal
     commandPipe could simply broadcast to a signal, and each listener 
     case matches. Possibly multiple listeners can listen to the same 
     token such that when running from DB and a MEAME token is submitted 
     then we stop running from DB, and recording finalizes when data 
     source is switched.
     
**** Topic
     Topics are many in many out, more geared towards streaming mass data 
     than Signal (which lacks a Sink method). Topic and Signal can both 
     be implemented in terms of each other for my case, ignoring more 
     tricky effects wrt asynchronity.

**** More sophisticated pull
     By keeping the current model the problems above must be resolved.
     A signal should still be implemented in order to handle failure and/or 
     interruption of a task, for instance MCS hardware exploding.
     
*** Going with signals?
    The various methods in assemblers must now return an interrupt action which 
    can then be stored in the ProgramState case class.
   
** A better toplevel interface
*** Description
    In order to make SHODAN more flexible it is necessary to add support 
    for handling user actions that change the state of a running program. 
    In order to do this I have currently settled on a model where a signal 
    holding a program state is used, which is both read and set by a pipe 
    for user commands. 
    The signal has many listeners, and the listeners may alter the signal  
    state themselves, which leaves open the question about how to handle 
    cycles in the listener graph etc in a safe manner.
    While this is of course ultimately undecidable it would be nice to have 
    at least some measure of static analysis.
    Another problem with the current approach is the lack of atomicity, i.e it is 
    possible to set meameRunning to false without actually running the 
    corresponding IO[Unit] stopData.
   
    What is it that I actually want?
    Ideally I would like to have a language where I could specify constraints such as
    "If the data acquisition stops, so must any DB recording."
    "If data acquisition is restarted then recordings should stop"
    "If data acquisition start is issued when data acquisition is running then a restart is issued"
    etc...
   
**** A start stop class
     When starting a data broadcast I also want to get an action to stop the broadcast.
     One way to do this is to change the signature to IO[(IO[Unit],IO[Unit])] but in 
     this case it is not possible to tell which IO action runs the broadcast and which 
     stops it. To rectify this I simply made the InterruptableAction case class in utilz.
    
**** Doing unrelated things based on input
     When a RunFromDB token is received we would like to shut down MEAME in addition to 
     setting up the DB datastream. 
     In the initial solution I matched for StopMEAME | RunFromDB to run the MEAME shutdown, 
     but this has the effect that the 
    
**** The case for full match
     It would be useful if we could do a full version of match. In match we want a single value 
     (which is why non-exhaustive matching is a compiler error with sealed trait, or runtime 
     error if not)
    
     For some sealed ADT A we'd like fullMatch A to return NEL[A] or give a compiler error.
     Possibly we could allow a fullMatch A to return List[A] instead where the list may be 
     empty.
    
     For now it seems using partial functions is the best way to do this, simply run input 
     through all the PFs to get a List[Option[Action]] which I fold and collapse to a single 
     action!
    
     PartialFunction may not be what we're after since we run into awkward behavior when using 
     predicates. 
     With match we can mix a type match with a predicate (i.e case A if someCondition => ...) 
     however this is not so easy with the proposed partialFunction approach...
    
**** Ideal and real phase decoupling
     What if user commands simply changes the desired "ideal" state of the program, and it's up
     to the different components listening to the program state signal to change their state to 
     reflect this? This way user commands could be idempotent, meaning in order to restart 
     MEAME you would have to first turn it off, then back on. Is this really desirable?
    
**** A case match recursively calling itself until it is resolved?
     A two-tiered system where the cmd pipe can issue new commands to itself. This fixes the case
     where a restart is issued. Now the cmd pipe can for instance issue a shutdown then a start 
     command to itself in the case that it receives a start command when already started (restart).
    
     Won't work without semaphores and similar to synchronize between the signal handlers and the 
     command pipeline. Atm I'm too tired of this mess, so I'm just going to have to be brutally practical tm...

*** Resolution
    The chosen architecture is a commandPipe responsible for reading commands and changing the 
    ideal program state based on this. 
    Several listeners discrete stream changes to program state and respond accordingly, modifying 
    the program state as they go. Definitely not a perfect approach, does not make nasty race 
    conditions hard to express, but needs to be settled.
    
*** Thoughts
    Some of the issues might stem from stuffing all inputs into a single pipe.
    Maybe the HTTP server could handle most of it, if not all?
    
** A bug in fs2
   TODO write about it
   
** Setup woes
*** Problem: The tire-fire of DB mgmt
    Apparently you must change pg_hba to use md5...
*** Problem: st. olavs machine doesn't like outside IP
    This problem was difficult to diagnose correctly as http4s simply halted.
    Decided to check it with restclient.el (after some silly pointless hesitation)
    and realized that the request just got swallowed in a quagmire before timing out. Thanks NTNU

    Solution was to use wireguard and the following tutorial
    https://securityespresso.org/tutorials/2019/03/22/vpn-server-using-wireguard-on-ubuntu/
   
    note the step where the interface esn3 (or smth like that) is supplied, remember to change this.

*** Problem: DB in invalid state
    The current scheme seems to be invalid in some form, thus restoring from dump fails to correctly
    add rows to the table containing resource URIs.
    This triggers a doobie sanity check error which was really obnoxious to figure out with no stack trace.
    Suggestion for next time: Consider creating a query print mode for easier debugging
*** Problem: ZIP not in path
    Minor issue, when deleting jvm while an sbt session is running this error occurs.
    Happened because I went from 11.03  to 8 for metals reasons.

* Clogged stream checklist
  + NYI exceptions might end up being swallowed
  + Check if all streams are running, not just the head of a stream of streams etc.
  + Check for Stream[F,Nothing] >> Stream[F,A]
    This is wrong, should be Stream[F,Nothing] ++ Stream[F,A]
** Previous cases
     
*** The mystery of the silent topics
   I suspect this issue has been a problem for a long time, but I finally found it when
   working on porting the GA to the new generalized framework.
   This gave me a very large surface of errors, I'm not sure it was a good idea, or if I
   would have been better off using the old GA stuff, which at least worked.
   After unsuccessfully looking at the GA and generalized pipe code I decided to test if
   data was even getting through which I did by printing the head of the list of streams from
   topic in Assemblers. This only worked because I happened to choose the first topic, which
   it turns out had all the data. I then tried to rewrite roundrobin yet again (poor round
   robin was likely framed many times because of this silly bug). When I couldn't get that 
   to work, I tried to simply interleave the two first streams, which also clogged! I then
   attempted to run output only from the second stream, which gave no output! This made me 
   realize that in all likelyhood the broadcaster had a bug, which it indirectly did. The
   broadcaster simply multiplexes tagged segments based on their channel tag, tags which was
   added in the tag pipe. The tag pipe was the source of the bug in the end, as it didn't 
   actually increment the tag inbetween segments! OOPS!!!
   Fix: 
   
   >>>>>>
   Pull.output1(TaggedSegment(n, seg.toVector)) >> go(n%60, tl)
   <<<<<<
   Pull.output1(TaggedSegment(n, seg.toVector)) >> go((n + 1) % 60, tl)
          
*** Return of the unimplemented method
    Implemented a new pipe for producing stimulus signal periods. The function from Hz to 
    period was not implemented but the exception was swallowed.
    This should be tested properly, but until then using ??? is very dangerous since NYI 
    errors might be swallowed.

* On testing
  Scala has 3 major testing frameworks.
  + ScalaCheck
    Focuses on property-based testing 
  + specs2
    Concentrates on behavior-drive development. 
  + ScalaTest 
    a flexible testing platform.
    "ScalaTest enables teams to use the style of testing that fits them best, and
    supports property-based testing via integration with ScalaCheck."
  
  These frameworks are compatible with each other, typically
  ScalaTest and ScalaCheck are used in conjunction.

   
* Adding sideband data?
  It could for some recordings be interesting to record when stim is running, in
  case we want to use all electrodes.
  This should be something that can be replicated, but why not just make it explicit?

* Experiment
  Is not as powerful as I had hoped wrt the problems implementing XOR
  
  Should experiment take care of the evaluator pipe stuff?

* XOR
** TODO detail what was difficult with XOR

* Random Kleisli tanker
  Si at jeg har 
  
  fa: Kleisli[IO,Z,A]
  fb: A => IO[B]
  
  Hva er egentlig Kleisli[IO,Z,A]?
  Z => IO[A]
  
  ok, Hva er Kleisli[IO,Z,A].flatMap?
  
  flatMap(fza: Kleisli[IO,Z,A])(f: A => Kleisli[IO,Z,B]): Kleisli[IO,Z,B]
  
  
  tenk 

  def getA(z: DB): IO[A]
  def getB(z: DB, a: A): IO[B]
  
  Vi kan gjøre
  val db: DB = new DBconn
  val aPartial = getA(z)
  val bPartial = getB(z)
  
  aPartial flatMap ( a => bPartial(a) )
  > IO[B]
  
  For å slippe dette/garantere at de får samme conf så kan vi heller

  def getA = Kleisli[IO,Z,A]
  def getB(a) = Kleisli[IO,Z,B]
  
  for {
    a <- getA
    b <- getB(a)
  } yield b

  som da er av typen Kleisli[IO,Z,B]
  
  som betyr at gitt en Z har vi en IO[B]
  
  la oss si at vi har en

  def getA = IO[A]
  def getB(a: A): Kleisli[IO,Z,B]

  hvordan kan vi enkelt gjøre om getA til en Kleisli[IO,Z,A]?
  

  Vel og bra det, men!

  Hva hvis vi har 
  def getA(z: DB): (A, DB)
  def getB(z: DB): B

  Altså, at getA ikke bare tar DB, men endrer den
  

  So I have a question about Reader and State.
  Say I have some functions

  ``` scala
  def getAthenSet: State[Conf,A] = ???
  def getB: Reader[Conf,B] = ???
  ```
  
  

* Gitter questions
  How can I terminate a stream that is being observed?
  
  myStream
    .observe(someSink)
    .take(4)

  Here someSink won't get terminated, thus we need to use Some/None
