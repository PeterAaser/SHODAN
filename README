SHODAN is a framework for performing reservoir computing.

Currently SHODAN offers functionality for using reservoir data sent over TCP
to control a simple agent, as well as sending input to the reservoir.
Database storage and playback is included but still fairly rough.

While the aim of SHODAN is to offer functionality for any reservoir it is
currently only geared towards in vitro neurons sent from the MEAME
server using the multichannel systems MEA2100 neural interface.

The system is still in development and not intended for general use,
so no API or guide is currently in the works.
